# Welcome to my website

I am a first-year MS Biostatistics student at the Columbia University, New York. I am originally from Vietnam but moved to the Seattle, WA 7 years ago for my bachelor degree and have been here ever since. 

This is my best friend, Thomas. He loves hiking, stuffed animals and meeting other humans.
